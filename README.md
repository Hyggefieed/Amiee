## ✨ Project Overview

**Therapeutic Healing App** is a cutting-edge mental wellness platform designed to provide compassionate, real-time support for individuals dealing with trauma, anxiety, and depression. By leveraging AI-driven insights, the app acts as a personal, non-judgmental companion, delivering guidance and interventions tailored to each user’s emotional state.  

**Core Highlights:**  
- **Humanized AI Conversations** – Empathetic, context-aware dialogues that respond dynamically to user behavior and trauma history.  
- **Wellness Check-ins** – Regular nudges for therapy, meditation, yoga, exercise, and medication adherence to encourage holistic mental well-being.  
- **Silent Healing Mode** – Gesture- and tap-based interactions for users who struggle to express themselves verbally, ensuring accessibility and comfort.  
- **Safety-first System** – Real-time location tracking with alerts for safe and unsafe zones, prioritizing personal security.  
- **Emergency SOS Alerts** – Immediate notifications to trusted contacts during crisis moments.  

The app integrates advanced **AI/NLP models (OpenAI, HuggingFace)** for sentiment analysis and humanized responses. **WebSocket-powered real-time communication** ensures instant support, while the backend built with **Node.js/Express and Python** provides a scalable, secure foundation for API services.  

At its heart, the platform embodies the philosophy:  
*"A Friend in Need is a Friend Indeed"* – ensuring every user feels supported, understood, and safe throughout their mental wellness journey.
